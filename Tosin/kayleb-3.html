                <p>Research enables me to dig deep into my understanding of users - not only their immediate frustration, but also their hopes, fears, abilities, limitations, reasoning and goals. It lays essentials foundation for creating solutions in later stages.</p>
                    <span>To ensure the research stays on track and better guide the mobile aoo design, it is important to create a research plan before diving into the research phase.

    <h3>Secondary Research</h3>

    <div class="text-1">
        <h4>Market Research</h4>
            <p>It is important to get a big picture of the market by starting with market research - to get a sense of what we know and don't know yet, who the audience are, as well as what the recent trends or news are. The insights gathered from market research will help me frame provisional personas and ask meaningful questions in primary research.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overall: the Nigerian fintech industry has remained a greatly influential, promising and biggest fintech app space in the world. Over the years, the fintech industry has remained a massive, greatly influential global consumer market, with 200 Fintech companies</li>
                    <li>Generally, there are 3 types of fintech companies for users in Nigeria.  The first type is an actual banking app where people can save and transfer money, more like “banking industry gone technology”, the second type is the Microfinance banking system where the fintech company basic objective is to provide suite and comfortable loan, mortgage and what not to it’s user, while the third one is the for businesses and individuals to make their international remittance process seamless, this entail access to USD accounts and virtual cards to make international payment on various platforms around the world.</li>

    <div class="text-2">
        <h4>Demographics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall: A very high population of youths (Tech bros and Sis) in Nigeria would rather get access to their money right from their comfort zone than having to go to banks to make complains and what not, especially in given the fact that they can easily receive their wage right into their wallet and not having to go through the hustle of opening a Paypal account.  Therefore they are likely to be the users of fintech products.</li>

These insights also help me identify any gaps in features that Cashwise might address. I analyzed 3 direct competitors, who are trying to solve the same problem as cashwise. </p>

            <h4>User Interview</h4>
                <p>Building on a general understanding of the market and the audience, I continued to dive deeper and build a real connection with our users, to gain direct insights on them by primary research.I created an Interview Guide to facilitate the user interview process, with 10 open-ended questions listed to invite the participants to share their experiences and stories.In total, 5 participants (3 males and 2 females) were interviewed about their reading and book organizing experience (if there is any) in the past.</p>

    <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>Since I have gathered a bunch of knowledge of the audience, as well as their goals and needs, I use the user persona to represent key audience segments.

                        <p>To assist the users to navigate through the application better and identify the main flow of users when they are completing a task, I created a task flows centring on the key features of Cashwise. In this way, I was able to decide what I am designing, and think through the necessary steps and examine the user experience in details. Below is the flow for each task.</p>

                    <h5>Low-fi Sketches</h5>
                        <p>After establishing the pain point, with a to-do list for designing the key screens identified in the task flow and user flow. I sketched multiple low-fidelity screens options to test and see major functionalities to optimize the user experience. I can capture my ideas with pen and paper quickly by sketching. It also enables me to examine my ideas before putting everything in the daunting process of digitizing.  After a few rounds of iterations I came to a good place with the solutions.</p>

                    <p>Once I had a visual direction of the layout, I started to add more details and precisions to the sketches by turning them into hi-fidelity wireframes. Creating mid-fidelity wireframes helps me have an already laid out view for the prototype, I tried to incorporate common design patterns that have been tested on our competitors' product, or included elements that directly address users' goals, needs, frustrations, and motivations. </p>

            <h5>Hi-Fidelity Wireframes and Prototype</h5>
            <p>In the case of this project i had to take the wire frame for a user review of some colleagues in the product design business to get feedbacks before moving to the hi-fidelity wireframe, which i got some really in-sighting feedbacks which then led to a lot of reiteration. After a long review of the wireframe i then came to perfect conclusion which meets my clients expectations and requirements and also the user experience i was hoping to achieve. </p>

            <h3>Conclusion & Final Thought</h3>
            <p>After 8 weeks of hard work, I'm glad to finally put a full stop to the project. It's been an amazing journey working on this product design job and seeing how it grew from a simple concept to a refined and polished product. As a creative, it's been especially exciting to explore my own creative ideas and work with an incredible team who shared similar interests and points of view. </p>
                <p class="p2">I had to cut corners at times, try different approaches to find the right answer, and even figure out what was wrong with certain details that didn't look right. From the creative brief to the final version of the design, this job has been a great learning experience. </p>
                <p class="p3">The outcome is something that I'm very proud of, and I'm looking forward to making more improvements as the project progresses. I'm confident that with the right feedback and some additional testing and optimization, this product is sure to make an impact.</p>
                <p class="p4">It was definitely a challenging project, but nonetheless it was incredibly rewarding to see the product get crafted with such care and precision.</p>
